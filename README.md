# Count-Occurrences
Summary: C++ program that counts word occurrences and reports which words occur the most.

This program accepts two separate text files and maps every word, along with the number of occurrences of each word, from both files. The program then accepts input in the form of a number from the user. It will then output the most occurring words and their occurrences from greatest to least occurrence. The user's input will determine the point at which the program terminates.

Example: If user input is 5, the program will output the 5 most occuring words.
